Bi is my own programming langage

## Description

Bi is my programming langage inspire of the C.

But in Bi, you will almost never view text. Why ? 

Beaucause, i transform the mostly used function in 0 and 1, same for logical instruction, calcul instruction ect...

## How to run the code ?

You need to clone / copy the 'compilateur.py' in your workspace and, for code,

you need to create .bi file and code inside. Whe you have finished, you can make ./compilateur.py [file1.bi] [file2.bi] [...] or python3 compilateur.py [file1.bi] [file2.bi] [...]
