# Bi
**Bi** is my own programming language.

## Description

**Bi** is my programming language inspired by C.

But in **Bi**, you will almost never see text. Why?

Because I transform the most commonly used functions into 0s and 1s, the same for logical instructions, calculation instructions, etc.

## How to run the code?

You need to clone or copy the `compilateur.py` file into your workspace. To code, you need to create a `.bi` file and write your code inside it. When you have finished, you can run `./compilateur.py [file1.bi] [file2.bi] [...]` or `python3 compilateur.py [file1.bi] [file2.bi] [...]`.

## How to code in **Bi**?

To code in **Bi**, you have two solutions to understand how **Bi** works:

1. Study `compilateur.py` - Yes, if you read and understand how `compilateur.py` works, you can find out how the **Bi** language works. (PS: If you find how to optimize it, you can contact me at: [matheo.campanella@epitech.eu](mailto:matheo.campanella@epitech.eu))
